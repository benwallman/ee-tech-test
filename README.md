This is the Equal Experts tech test. It's only 90 minutes long, so a lot of this is rushed.

The choices I made were to use Next.js, Jest and TypeScript.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

And then follow the steps from [create-next-app's documentation](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) to handle deployment.
